# Fetch-papers-using-thePubMed-API
This project demonstrates my ability to build a production-ready command-line tool in Python using real-world data from the PubMed API.  It fetches research papers based on any user-defined query and filters out those with at least one author from a pharmaceutical or biotech company. This simulates practical data analysis workflows.
